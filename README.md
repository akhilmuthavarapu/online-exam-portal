## Explanation of the Python code using PyWebIO for an exam

This code creates a simple online exam using the PyWebIO library. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

**Imports:**

- `from pywebio.input import *`: Imports all input functions from PyWebIO.
- `from pywebio.output import *`: Imports all output functions from PyWebIO.

**`exam()` function:**

1. **Initialization:**
    - Sets `c` to 0 to keep track of correct answers.
2. **Authentication:**
    - Prompts the user for their name using `input()` with type "text".
    - Prompts the user for their hall ticket number using `input()` with type "password" for privacy.
    - Checks if the entered password matches either "21kh1a6" or "21KH1A6" (case-insensitive).
3. **Exam questions:**
    - If authentication is successful:
        - Opens a file named "p1.txt" to read questions.
        - Each question is presented using `radio()`, a function that displays options and returns the selected one:
            - The question text is obtained by reading from the file.
            - Four answer options are read from the file and converted to strings.
            - If the user's selection matches the correct answer (hardcoded in the code), `c` is incremented.
        - This process repeats for 5 questions.
4. **Result Display:**
    - Displays the user's name and score (`c`).
    - Uses `style()` to change the color of the result ("passed" in green, "failed" in red).
5. **Conclusion:**
    - Thanks the user for participating.

**Note:**

- The code contains security concerns as the password is directly compared in the script. It's advisable to implement proper password hashing and storage mechanisms in a real application.
- The correct answers are hardcoded within the script, making it inflexible. A better approach would be to store questions and answers in a separate file or database.
- The code lacks error handling for situations like incorrect password or file reading issues.
